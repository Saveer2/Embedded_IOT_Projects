** ClimaGuard â€” Arduino Temperature & Humidity Monitor with Alerts ** 

ClimaGuard is an Arduino-based project that continuously monitors temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor, displays values on an OLED screen, and provides visual + audio alerts with an RGB LED module, active buzzer, and passive buzzer.

** Components = 

1.  Arduino UNO
2.  DHT11 (temperature & humidity sensor)
3.  SSD1306 OLED display (128Ã—64, IÂ²C)
4.  RGB LED module (common cathode)
5.  3 Ã— 220 Î© resistors (for R, G, B pins)
6.  Active buzzer
7.  Passive buzzer
8.  Breadboard + jumper wires

** Features

1.  OLED Display: Live temperature (Â°C) and humidity (%) values.
2.  RGB LED Alerts:
ðŸ”µ Blue â†’ Temperature below 30 Â°C (Normal)
ðŸŸ¢ Green â†’ Temperature between 30â€“35 Â°C (Warning)
ðŸ”´ Red â†’ Temperature above 35 Â°C (Danger)
3.  Active Buzzer Alerts:
  * One short beep every 10 sec in Warning mode.
  * One short beep every 1 sec in Danger mode.
4.  Passive Buzzer Alerts: Plays an emergency melody if temperature exceeds 35 Â°C.
