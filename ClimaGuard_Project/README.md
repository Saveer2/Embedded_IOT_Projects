ClimaGuard â€” Arduino Temperature & Humidity Monitor with Alerts

ClimaGuard is an Arduino-based project that continuously monitors temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor, displays values on an OLED screen, and provides visual + audio alerts with an RGB LED module, active buzzer, and passive buzzer.

** Components

Arduino UNO

DHT11 (temperature & humidity sensor)

SSD1306 OLED display (128Ã—64, IÂ²C)

RGB LED module (common cathode)

3 Ã— 220 Î© resistors (for R, G, B pins)

Active buzzer

Passive buzzer

Breadboard + jumper wires

** Features

OLED Display: Live temperature (Â°C) and humidity (%) values.

RGB LED Alerts:

ðŸ”µ Blue â†’ Temperature below 30 Â°C (Normal)

ðŸŸ¢ Green â†’ Temperature between 30â€“35 Â°C (Warning)

ðŸ”´ Red â†’ Temperature above 35 Â°C (Danger)

Active Buzzer Alerts:

One short beep every 10 sec in Warning mode.

One short beep every 1 sec in Danger mode.

Passive Buzzer Alerts: Plays an emergency melody if temperature exceeds 35 Â°C.
